                    The cryptocurrency market has seen explosive growth, with meme-coins drawing short-term speculative interest due to high volatility. 
                    However, these coins lack intrinsic value, often resulting in significant devaluation over time. 
                    ANGRY addresses this issue by introducing art-coins, which incorporate AI-generated art, 
                        bringing an artistic and cultural purpose that preserves its financial relevance long-term.

                    Angry Bunny (ANGRY) is an innovative project within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, introducing the concept of art-coins, 
                        surpassing the limitations of traditional meme-coins. 
                    By backing its value with AI-generated art, ANGRY offers a sustainable and culturally relevant alternative in digital markets. 
                    This fusion of cryptocurrency and art aims to mitigate speculative volatility and provide lasting intrinsic value to investors and community participants.

                    Art-coins are cryptocurrencies backed by generative artworks created through AI. 
                    Unlike meme-coins, art-coins offer intrinsic value by being associated with unique, collectible artistic ./assets. 
                    This combines the excitement and community engagement of the crypto space with the appreciation and value of digital art, 
                        creating a more sustainable asset less prone to depreciation.

                <a class="strong">Universe</a> <br> 
                The Universe defines the aesthetic and conceptual context. 
                It can only be added by the Killcopyright Foundation, projected to happen at intervals of at least two years.

            <div>
                <a class="strong">Zones</a> <br> 
                Zones are aesthetic subspaces within the Universe, exclusively defined by the Foundation. 
                They are more specific and maintain consistency with the Universe’s guidelines.
            </div>
            <div>
                <a class="strong">Fragments</a> <br> 
                Fragments represent specific moments in space and time, similar to scenes in a movie.
                 They focus on defined situations and physical environments, maintaining coherence with the Zone and Universe. 
                 The creation of Fragments is not exclusive to the Foundation; any community member can propose one, although this requires validation and incurs a cost.

                <a class="strong">Artwork</a> <br> 
                Artworks are visual representations created explicitly through generative AI, using models approved during the area creation process, 
                    describing specific aspects of the Fragment. 
                Each Artwork is selected from various community-generated proposals. 
                These proposals undergo a competitive curation process managed by the Foundation’s AI, considering artistic quality, creativity, 
                    relevance to the Fragment, Zone, and Universe, and contribution to the diversity of the NFT collection.
            </div>
            <div>
                <a class="strong">Art Proposal</a> <br> 
                Art Proposals are AI-generated community artworks based on Fragment prompts or newly crafted prompts for each proposal. 
                For the automated curation system to select an Art Proposal and transform it into an accepted, validated Artwork, 
                    a specific number of proposals determined by Difficulty is required.
                Then, a competitive curation process selects a final piece, added to the Fragment as a definitive NFT.
                <br> <br>
                All proposals must adhere to a generative model approved and declared within the Area, presented with the prompt for validation. 
                This ensures consistency and quality in the creative process, recognizing participants as active artists in the project and community.
            </div>
            <div>
                <a class="strong">Difficulty & Fragment Size</a> <br> 
                Difficulty is a parameter adjusted by the Foundation to manage the speed at which pools of artistic proposals are filled. 
                If the project generates high interest and numerous proposals quickly, difficulty increases. 
                This maintains a consistent interval, roughly every ten minutes, between each newly selected work (i.e., each “minted block”).
                <br> <br>
                This mechanism is similar to blockchain difficulty in networks like Bitcoin, where difficulty adjusts the block generation time to maintain network stability. 
                In ANGRY, this ensures a steady selection rate for artworks, unaffected by sudden increases in proposals.
                <br> <br>
                Area size is another parameter adjusted by the Foundation to align with project interest levels.

                    Angry Bunny relies on five publicly available smart contracts.

                    Every 210,240 blocks, the reward per block halves until reaching a limit. 
                    This halving mechanism, similar to other cryptocurrencies, controls inflation and increases scarcity over time. 
                    The halving interval was calculated so that, with a consistent 10-minute Artwork validation interval (block creation), halving occurs every four years.

                    Collaboration units are tokens issued by the Foundation, representing participation and potential rewards within the project. 
                    These tokens are issued in limited quantities, distributed in phases aligned with ANGRY’s halving events. 
                    Each phase reduces reward probability, encouraging new participants. 
                    With each phase, issued units increase linearly, balancing unit supply with new collaborator entry.
                    <br><br>
                    The Foundation initially owns these units but receives no rewards for holding them. 
                    Later, they are sold to interested Art Patreons, financing project stages and rewarding founders.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, collaboration units can be transferred or sold, adding liquidity and value, encouraging investment. 
                    Collaboration units are implemented as non-divisible ERC20 (PTRN), enabling trading beyond the Foundation.
                    <br><br>
                    The maximum number of collaboration units is 15,000, distributed as follows:<br>
                        •	1,000 as an initial issue.<br>
                        •	1,660 at the first halving.<br>

                    This collaboration model fosters a vibrant and committed community, where traditional patronage is updated and intertwined with technological innovation. 
                    In this way, ANGRY strengthens the creative network around the idea that generative art can be both a cultural asset and a 
                        valuable, enduring resource without succumbing to empty speculative dynamics.

                    Angry Bunny (ANGRY) emerges as a profoundly innovative project redefining the convergence between art and technology, 
                        leaving a significant cultural footprint through the use of artificial intelligence. 
                    At the core of this proposal is the concept of art-coins, an evolution in cryptocurrency that directly links digital 
                        value with AI-generated artistic creation. 
                    Unlike traditional speculative approaches, art-coins provide purpose and intrinsic value, as each unit of value is backed 
                        by unique and carefully curated artworks. 
                    This model not only preserves artistic value but also fosters a deeper connection between participants and creative production, 
                        transforming the relationship between technology and art.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The concept of art-coins extends beyond its initial application in ANGRY.
                    While the project focuses on AI-generated works, the structure of art-coins is versatile enough to support other forms of artistic expression. 
                    This means that, theoretically, art-coins could be used in the future to link with other artistic formats such as digital music, photography, 
                        or any other creative work. 
                    This potential highlights the capability of art-coins to act as a bridge between various forms of art and technology, 
                        ensuring that cultural value remains relevant in a constantly transforming world.

                <p>
                    In ANGRY, artificial intelligence plays a key role in creating and curating artworks. 
                    Generative models enable the production of pieces that are both aesthetically coherent and culturally significant, 
                        while automated processes ensure that the selection of works is objective, based on criteria of quality, innovation, and diversity. 
                    This approach not only optimizes artistic creation but also democratizes access, as any community member can contribute proposals 
                        that will be evaluated transparently.

                <p>
                    In summary, Angry Bunny redefines how art is understood and valued in the technological age, proposing a model in which art-coins 
                        become a vehicle to preserve and expand the cultural impact of digital art. 
                    The fusion of advanced technology and creativity not only expands the boundaries of what is possible in art but also provides a 
                        framework for generative art and new forms of cultural expression to continue evolving. 
                    With ANGRY, art and technology unite deeply, creating a lasting legacy where artistic value is amplified and transformed into a collective, 
                        accessible resource for all.
